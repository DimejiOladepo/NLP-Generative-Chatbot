# NLP-Generative-Chatbot
A simple chatbot which answers simple questions around general topics generatively built with Keras and Tensorflow

It makes use of question and answers around certain topics and trains a Recurrent Neural Network with an embedding
layer as input. These questions and answers were sourced from Kaggle's open datasets.
